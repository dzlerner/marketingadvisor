HIGH-LEVEL GOALS & BACKGROUND:

I want to start a business focused on helping small businesses stand up their digital marketing presence. This might include learning about the business, developing a marketing strategy, and then helping the customer onboard and begin executing basic advertising to start their business off (in the future, we can expand into more comprehensive, ongoing marketing guidance and strategy). I think my MVP should be to prove the concept of an AI assisted onboarding and ad setup workflow on Google Ads. This will help me gain confidence and build similar agents, rounding out the ecosystem.

The base requirements for the MVP would be:

1. Learn and ask relevant questions about your business
2. Develop a marketing strategy
3. Create a Google account (or guide you to do it)
4. Configure new ads, budgets, and targeting, etc. (or guide you)
5. Guide you to start the campaign
6. It must have a web UI
